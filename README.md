# CS49 (Foundations of Computer Programming) Projects
## CS49: What is it?
CS49 was a course offered to high school students (for college credits) by Make School in partnership with Foothill College. During it, I learned concepts such as variables, functions, classes, conditional statements, and more. I built various projects using JavaScript and the p5.js libary and worked effectively with my peers when completing lab challenges and giving/receiving feedback.

## Conway's Game of Life
### ðŸ¤” What is it?
My recreation of John Conway's Game of Life. I used conditional statements, classes, and various functions to create a working Game of Life that begins with a randomly generated grid of "alive" cells. I completed this project over the course of a week. <br>

## Music Recommender
### ðŸ¤” What is it?
My final project for the CS49 course. I combined all of the knowledge I gained about JavaScript and the p5.js library during the course to create a music recommender that presents users with songs and albums using Spotify iframes from an array. I wanted to involve user input, dynamic visuals, and an interest of mine: music, to create a project that I completed over the course of two weeks. <br>
